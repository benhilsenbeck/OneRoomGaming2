<h2><b>League Website</b></h2>
This is a website that I created just to give me something to do. You would
signup for the website and then you could make a profile by entering in your
games username. Then there would be different stats that would get pulled up and
would show you how you did in your games and would show you some other stats.

<h2><b>Tech</b></h2>
I used react as the fronted for the website and used Django to handle the
backend api requests. I also setup Jenkins for continous integration to easily
push any updates I wanted to the website right away.

<h2><b>Current Status</b></h2>
The website has the basics of information available to the user but there could
be much more that was added to the website. Since this project is just for fun I
might come back to it and give it some more updates or this could be the final
product.
